<p>Hello! This wiki was created by Joe Wolfe partly as a Capstone project for my Springboard education, but it was
    mainly as a passion project to create a simple place for me to make notes digitally for the pathfinder game. You can
    add Categories and pages in order to keep track of any NPCâ€™s. Locations, the sky's the limit. I will be updating
    this project with more features So check back frequently to see what is new!
