DinWiki is a web application I designed to collaboratively take notes with my friends while we play Dungeons and Dragons together.  It provides a simple and intuitive platform for for groups to organize information and work together on various topics.

# Features
## Creating categories
Users can create categories to organize their notes efficiently. Categories help in grouping related information together, making it easier to navigate and find content.

## Add pages
Within each category, users can add pages to document specific details, discussions, or tasks. Pages serve as containers for collaborative note-taking on a particular subtopic.

## Add Sections
Enhance the organization of your notes by adding sections to pages. Sections allow users to separate important information within a page, providing a structured and easy-to-follow format.
